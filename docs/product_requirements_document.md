# AI Dungeon Master - Product Requirements Document

## Background and Problem Statement

Tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) like Dungeons & Dragons have been a popular form of collaborative storytelling and gaming for decades. However, traditional TTRPGs require a Dungeon Master to orchestrate the game, create narratives, manage rules, and control non-player characters. This creates a significant barrier to entry for new players and those who cannot find a consistent group to play with. Additionally, the complex rules system can be intimidating for beginners and time-consuming even for experienced players.

Many potential players face significant barriers to enjoying tabletop roleplaying games:
- Difficulty finding a skilled and available Dungeon Master
- Challenges coordinating schedules among multiple players
- Steep learning curve for game rules and mechanics
- Limited access to visual aids and battle maps
- Inconsistent gameplay experiences depending on the Dungeon Master's style and preparation
- Inability to play spontaneously or on-demand
- Lack of persistence in character development and campaign progression when groups disband

These barriers prevent many interested players from experiencing the rich storytelling and immersive gameplay that TTRPGs can offer, resulting in a significant unmet demand in the market.

## Product Vision Statement

Secure the Realm will democratize access to high-quality tabletop roleplaying experiences by providing an AI-powered platform that eliminates the need for a human Dungeon Master while preserving the creativity, flexibility, and immersion of traditional TTRPGs. Our vision is to create a system where anyone, anywhere can instantly jump into a personalized adventure tailored to their preferences, play style, and available time. Through specialized AI agents working in concert, we will deliver a seamless, engaging, and visually rich gaming experience that adapts to player choices and creates memorable stories worth sharing.

## Architecture

The Secure the Realm platform is built on the Python Microsoft Semantic Kernel framework, Typescript frontend. Semantic Kernel provides a multi-agent architecture, where each agent serves a specialized role in the tabletop RPG experience. Semantic Kernel will interface with Azure OpenAI LLMs using Python to enable the use of "plugins". This allows the LLMs to perform takes like storing and retrieving data. The Kernel enables the selection of the correct AI agent, function and plugin for the task at hand, rather than relying on a strict workflow.

## Agent Definitions

1. **Dungeon Master Agent (Orchestrator Agent)**
   - Primary user-facing agent that coordinates all other agents
   - Manages player interactions and conversation flow
   - Routes appropriate tasks to specialized agents
   - Maintains cohesion across the gameplay experience
   - Ensures continuity of game rules and narrative

2. **Narrator Agent**
   - Manages campaign narrative and storylines
   - Determines whether a skill check is required
   - Handles skill checks, and outcomes
   - Maintains campaign facts and story elements
   - Generates descriptions of environments, NPCs, and situations
   - Interprets player actions within the game world context
   - Stores key narrative data in structured format for recall

3. **Scribe Agent**
   - Manages character sheets and player data
   - Tracks inventory, equipment, and loot
   - Handles NPC data and attributes
   - Monitors spell slots, abilities, and resources
   - Maintains structured data records for lookup and recall excluding campaign data managed by Narrator

4. **Combat MC Agent**
   - Creates balanced encounter scenarios based on narrative context from Dungeon Master
   - Manages enemy tactics and behaviors
   - Track initiative order and combat state
   - Integrates with Combat Cartographer to ensure effective encounter details related to the battle map
   - Integrates with Narrator for narrative around combat outcomes

5. **Combat Cartographer Agent**
   - Generates tactical battle maps based on narrative context from Narrator

6. **Artist Agent**
   - Generates visual imagery based on narrative moments
   - Creates character portraits and NPC visualizations
   - Illustrates environments and locations
   - Produces visual aids for important items, maps, and scenes
   - Enhances immersion through visual storytelling

## Communication Flow

While the Dungeon Master serves as the orchestrator, agents can communicate directly with each other when appropriate wit the below as just one example:

```
Player Input → Dungeon Master → Routes to appropriate agent(s)
                    ↓
Narrator ↔ Scribe ↔ Combat MC ↔ Artist
                    ↓
                Dungeon Master → Player Output
```

- Agents share context and request information from each other as needed
- The Dungeon Master synthesizes responses from multiple agents into coherent player-facing output
- Each agent maintains its specialized knowledge domain while contributing to the whole experience
- Agent communication shall be determined by the Kernel on Microsoft Semantic Kernel

## Technical Requirements

### Core System

- **Framework**: Typescript frontend with Python backend leveraging Semantic Kernel Agents
 - **API Integration**: Microsoft Semantic Kernel for agentic implementation. Whilst the LLMs will be powered by Azure OpenAI endpoints, the Semantic Kernel framework provides a layer of abstraction
- **State Management**: Robust state tracking for game progression
- **Data Storage**: Structured data format for game elements, character sheets, and campaign information
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate response to player actions

### Game Engine

- **Rules Implementation**: D&D 5e OGL SRD ruleset
- **Dice Rolling System**: Virtual dice implementation supporting all standard RPG dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100) and the ability of the user to bring their own dice by telling the DM what their roll or total score was
- **Character Management**: Character creation, leveling, and stat tracking in line with standard character sheets for 5th edition e.g. feats
- **Combat System**: Turn-based combat with initiative tracking and number of actions
- **Spell System**: Implementation of 5e spell mechanics and spell slots

### User Interface

- **Chat Interface**: Primary interaction through natural language conversation
- **Character Sheet Display**: Visual representation of character data available within the app
- **Map Visualization**: Display battle maps and illustrations separate to the chat interface the player is interacting with
- **Image Gallery**: Storage for generated imagery and campaign visuals separate to the chat interface by the application (not the AI) saving that image and updating the image URL
- **Dice Roll Visibility**: Numeric feedback for dice outcomes where the game has rolled on behalf of the player, at the request of the player
- **Session History**: Summary record of game events and conversations

4. Story Master updates narrative state as needed
5. Quarter Master updates character/world data as needed
6. Battle Master creates combat scenarios when triggered
7. Art Master generates imagery for significant moments
8. Dungeon Master synthesizes responses and presents to player

### Combat Workflow

1. Battle Master establishes combat environment and participants
2. Quarter Master provides character and NPC statistics
3. Story Master provides narrative context
4. Battle Master generates tactical map
5. Art Master visualizes the battle scene
6. Combat rounds proceed through initiative order
