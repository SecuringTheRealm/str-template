## üéØ Template Repository

This is a GitHub template repository designed for AI-powered applications using Python backends with Semantic Kernel and TypeScript/React frontends. It provides a comprehensive project structure with documentation templates, coding standards, and architectural decision record (ADR) templates.

### üìã Getting Started with This Template

1. **Create a new repository from this template**
   - Click "Use this template" button on GitHub
   - Choose a name for your new repository
   - Select public or private visibility

2. **Customize your project**
   - Replace `[Your Project Name]` with your actual project name
   - Update the project description placeholder
   - Modify badge URLs to point to your repository
   - Update the project vision and background sections below

3. **Update documentation**
   - Customize `docs/product_requirements_document.md` with your specific requirements
   - Add your own ADRs to `docs/adr/` following the template
   - Update coding instructions in `.github/instructions/` as needed

üìñ **See [TEMPLATE_USAGE.md](TEMPLATE_USAGE.md) for detailed instructions on using this template.**

### üèóÔ∏è What's Included

- **Structured project layout** for Python backend and TypeScript frontend
- **Documentation templates** including PRD and technical specifications

## üìñ Project Overview

[Replace this section with your project's specific content]

[Your project description goes here. Explain what your application does, who it's for, and what problems it solves.]

## Background and Problem Statement

[Replace this section with your project's specific background]

[Describe the problem your application solves. What challenges do your users face? What gap in the market are you addressing? Include relevant statistics or research if applicable.]

[Example structure:
- Current state of the problem
- Why existing solutions fall short
- Who is affected by this problem
- The impact of not solving this problem]

## Architecture

[Replace this section with your project's specific architecture]

This template is designed for applications built with Python Microsoft Semantic Kernel framework backends and TypeScript frontends. The architecture supports multi-agent AI systems where specialized agents work together to deliver comprehensive functionality.

[Example architecture description:
- **Backend**: Python with Semantic Kernel for AI agent orchestration
- **Frontend**: TypeScript/React for user interface
- **AI Integration**: Azure OpenAI or other LLM providers
- **Data Storage**: [Your chosen database/storage solution]
- **Deployment**: [Your deployment strategy]]

### Key Components
- **Agent Framework**: Semantic Kernel enables specialized AI agents with distinct roles
- **Plugin System**: Allows LLMs to perform specific tasks like data storage and retrieval
- **Dynamic Routing**: Kernel selects appropriate agents and functions based on context
- **State Management**: Maintains consistency across agent interactions
